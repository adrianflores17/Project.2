This bar graph shows the percentage of dog rescues each year. It also shows the percentage of dogs getting transferred out of the shelters because of their breeds or disabilities.As you guys can see the year that there was the most rescues was 2011. That is absolutely sad because that means nobody is doing anything to save abused,neglected, and hurt dogs. The red percent in this graph shows the percentage of dogs getting transferred out of dog shelters because of their breed. How are you going to discriminate against a dog that has no hope. They are often kicked out of the shelter then abused by society.

	<p>This pie chart shows the different kinds of deaths dogs have a year. The biggest percentage of dog abuse is neglect. Which basically means that dogs are abandoned the most. Neglection is a sort of dog abuse because if you're committed to a living creature you should not abandoned it.Dogs being shot is a big percentage of leading dog deaths and this is ridiculous. How is someone going to shoot a living creature.
