	<p>Here is a picture of a puppy mill. As you can see even puppies are brought here. They are not fed, they are over cramped, and are not getting any exercise, so they often become depressed and can die from depression.There are organizations that go to puppy mills and rescue all the dogs and puppies. You can make a change by going to www..save the dogs and signing up for the next time the organization goes to raid a puppy mill.</p>

<p>There are many ways we can solve this dog abuse problem. You can volunteer at a dog shelter and perhaps foster a dog so they won't get put in a rough home or even get put down. You can rescue dogs at puppy mills. As seen in the picture above you can see that there is a dog that has its mouth taped shut. But behind the dog you can see that it's getting rescued by a person.For those of you who don't know what puppy mills are they are basically a farm or acer feild where dogs are put in cramped cages and left to die. They are often sent their after they are useless in dog fights or they are taken there to breed non-stop until they are too weak and left to die.</p>

	 <p>As seen in the photo above you see a beat up dog that was at a puppy mill often getting abused. Then in the second picture you can see that it is the same dog but he doesn't really look the same as he did at the puppy mill. His name is Rasco and he was rescued by a married couple when they and their organization raided a puppy mill and saved over 80 dogs and 37 puppies. By simply adopting these [poor abused dogs you will be helping reduce the dog abuse rate.

	   <p>Look at how happy these dogs are once they were adopted. I highly encorugae you all to adopt a dog and give them a better life because they are all at the adoption center because they have often had a rough life. So be a kind hearted person and change that. :)</p>
